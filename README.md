WORKFLOW CA

This project is aims for students to acquire knowledge on proper testing. To be able to do automated unit-testing and end-to-end testing.

We are well provided with good modules to follow through and to understand the whole concepts and ideas for this.
Very beneficial or useful for the future of us students. With this project, we learned about testing in both ways, formulating our code syntax to
be equipped well for the testing, how to fork a repo, and how to follow standard step-by-step processes.
Learnings for cloning and initializing certain commits. trials and error, solving and understanding errors, and building up understanding through it.
From setting ups all the initial setups until the end of the testing, updating, and committing.
Building confidence and accessing all peer reviews to gain more ideas are very useful for this project.
Being introduced to and using cypress, testing it via electron, jest, ESLint and etc is very overwhelming.
Putting all the effort and heart into this project, sleepless nights and positive thinking makes it all worthwhile succeeding in a successful result.

Requirements to reach:

Project is configured to run Prettier on commit
