### Introduction

This is a forked project from Noroff to my Workflow course assignment where we are setting up a workflow for a social media client.

#### Workflow

The following has been done to incorporate a workflow environment:

* Incorporate pre-commit hooks
* Setup ESLint for code analysis
* Prettier for code formatting
* Jest for unit testing
* Cypress for E2E testing

Project uses GitHub Actions for code review and to push the code to GitHub Pages.
