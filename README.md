# Setting up a professional working environment for social-media-client

This pull request introduces several changes to set up a professional working environment for the social-media-client web application. It includes the addition of configuration files for ESLint and Cypress, GitHub Actions workflows for automated testing, and VS Code settings for automatic code formatting and linting using Prettier and ESLint. The changes also include updates to the .gitignore file, adding exclusions for log files, editor directories and files, and build artifacts. Additionally, new functions have been added to set up a counter and log a random joke to the console.
