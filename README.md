Git commit -m "whatever" makes eslint, prettier and jest run tro all my .js, .html files and fix them up

- npm create vite@latest to install vite and give me the files i needed, after that i took all the thinks from package.json put it in my root package.json and wrote "cd .." to go to my root and wrote "npm install" adn then "npm run build" to make my dist files. 
-Pages: i went on github settings, pressed pages on the left sidebar. used gtihub action and created a new pages file. this works.
