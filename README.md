# Workflows and Hooks

  

This project is configured to run several quality assurance and deployment tasks on each commit and merge. The following workflows and hooks are currently in place:

  

- Prettier: This tool automatically formats and lints code to ensure a consistent style throughout the project. It runs on each commit to ensure that all code is clean and easy to read.

  

- ESLint: This tool checks for syntax errors and other issues in JavaScript code. It runs on each commit to catch any issues before they make it into the codebase.

  

- Jest: This tool is used for testing. It runs on each commit to ensure that all code is functioning as expected.

  

- Deployment to pages: This hook is triggered on each merge to the default branch. It automatically deploys the latest version of the code to the project pages website.

  

## Status Badges

  

To help keep track of the status of these workflows and hooks, we have included the following badges in this readme file:

  

- Prettier: [![code style: prettier](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-prettier-ff69b4.svg)](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)

- ESLint: [![ESLint: Enabled](https://img.shields.io/badge/ESLint-Enabled-blue.svg)](https://eslint.org/)

- Jest: [![Jest: Tested](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jest-Tested-green.svg)](https://jestjs.io/)

- Deployment to pages: [![Deployment: Pages](https://img.shields.io/badge/Deployment-Pages-orange.svg)](https://pages.github.com/)

  
  

Additionally, we have made the following file changes to configure the project for hosting:

  

- Updated the project readme file to include the new configuration information and status badges

- Configured the project for hosting using a CDN or Bundler (e.g. Webpack)

  

This ensures that the project is properly set up for hosting and ready for deployment to a live server.

  

## Maintenance and Updates

  

To ensure that the project remains up-to-date and functioning smoothly, we will periodically run the following tasks:

  

- Run Prettier and ESLint on all code to maintain a consistent style and catch any syntax errors

- Run Jest tests to ensure that all code is functioning as expected

- Update the project readme with any new configuration information or status changes

- Check for and apply any necessary security updates or patches to the project

  

By following these steps, we can ensure that the project is always running smoothly and ready for deployment.
