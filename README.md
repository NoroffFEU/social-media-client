# Project Workflow

## Description

The Workflow repository is your go-to solution for streamlining the development process. By integrating powerful scripts and actions, we prioritize and maintain optimal code quality. Through meticulous linting and semantic validation, we ensure code consistency and syntax adherence, establishing a robust foundation for your codebase.

To maintain a high standard, we run tests before any code is committed to the main branch. This proactive approach helps prevent potential issues, providing a smooth and reliable development experience.

## Key Features

- **Linting:** Elevate your code quality with industry-best practices for consistency and syntax.

- **Building:** Transform source files into deployment-ready outputs, unlocking the full potential of your application.

- **Local Development:** Experience seamless development with instant feedback on file changes, boosting productivity and efficiency.

- **Unit & E2E Testing:** Rigorous testing protocols guarantee the functionality of your code, providing confidence in its reliability and performance.
