# Social Media Client

Welcome to the Social Media Client repository!

## Overview
Social Media Client is a cutting-edge social media application developed as a course assignment at Noroff. Our mission is to enhance an existing project by implementing various improvements and ensuring its robustness through thorough testing.

## Project Enhancements
As part of this assignment, we have undertaken several enhancements to elevate the quality and functionality of the project:

- **Code Quality**: We have configured the project with ESLint and Prettier to maintain consistent code style and formatting standards. Additionally, commit hooks have been set up to enforce these standards throughout the development process.

- **Continuous Integration**: Leveraging GitHub Actions, we have established automated build and deployment processes, ensuring seamless integration and delivery of code changes.

- **Bug Reporting**: Any discovered bugs or issues encountered during the enhancement process are diligently documented in the Issues tab for transparent tracking and resolution.

- **Testing Framework Integration**: To guarantee the reliability and stability of the application, we have integrated Jest and Cypress for comprehensive unit and end-to-end testing coverage.
